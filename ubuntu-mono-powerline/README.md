# Ubuntu mono Powerline

Ubuntu Mono fonts patched for the "Powerline" vim plugin: https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/

## How to use it

Assuming you already installed and configured vim-powerline, 
**if you're using Ubuntu** (or some similarly `.font`-configured linux variant), then all you need to
do is:

    cd ~/.fonts/ && git clone https://github.com/scotu/ubuntu-mono-powerline.git && cd ~

If you're using something else, like OSX, then you'll need to download these and install them the usual
way.
